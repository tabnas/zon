// tabnas-port-deps-template v1: stamped by tabnas/admin tasks/adopt-port-deps.js. Change the template and restamp, never this file.

// The TypeScript, Go and Rust ports of this repository must depend on the
// same tabnas repos at runtime.
//
// tools/port-deps.cjs reads ts/package.json, rs/Cargo.toml and the imports
// of the Go module under go/, and compares the three sets. A difference
// that is not repaired yet is recorded in tools/port-deps.json with its
// reason and its repair direction. An entry there that the manifests no
// longer support fails this test as loudly as a difference nobody recorded,
// so a repaired difference forces its entry's deletion. The rules are
// ADR-24 in tabnas/admin DECISIONS.md.
//
// The test sits in the TypeScript suite because that suite runs on every
// platform CI covers. It checks all three ports, not only this one.
