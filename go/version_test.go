// The baked-in VERSION must equal the package's declared version.
//
// This is the CI check for version drift. It exists because the constant HAS
// drifted in practice: jsonic-cli shipped 0.4.1 and 0.4.2 while its const sat
// at 0.4.0 (the release orchestrator's file discovery missed it), and
// @tabnas/json shipped a TS `Version` export reading 1.0.0 for several
// releases because nothing ever rewrote it. Both were invisible until someone
// read the file. A release that bumps package.json and forgets the constant
// now fails here instead of shipping a lie.
