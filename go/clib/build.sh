# CROSS-COMPILING USES ZIG. The library needs cgo, and cgo needs a C
# toolchain per target. `zig cc` is a cross compiler for all of them, so
# one Linux box can produce Linux and Windows artifacts:
#
#   ZIG=/path/to/zig ./build.sh all
#
# macOS is the exception and cannot be cross-compiled this way: linking
# needs Apple's SDK, which zig cannot redistribute. Build darwin
# artifacts on a macOS host; releases do not block on them (ADR-12
# clause 5 — the darwin lane is best-effort and additive).
