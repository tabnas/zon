## What this project is

`@tabnas/zon` is a **grammar plugin** that parses
[Zig Object Notation (ZON)](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#ZON)
— the data format used by Zig `build.zig.zon` manifests, built on Zig
anonymous struct literals:

```zon
.{
    .name = "example",
    .version = "0.0.1",
    .dependencies = .{ .foo = .{ .url = "https://..." } },
    .paths = .{ "build.zig", "src" },
}
```

Unlike `@tabnas/json` (a plugin on the bare engine), this is a
**jsonic plugin**: it layers on `@tabnas/jsonic`'s relaxed-JSON grammar
and then reshapes it into ZON. Install it on a jsonic-enabled engine —
`new Tabnas().use(jsonic).use(Zon)` (TS) / `jsonic.Make()` then
`UseDefaults(Zon, ...)` (Go). It does three things on top of jsonic:

1. **Disables jsonic extensions** it doesn't want (`rule.exclude:
   'jsonic,imp'` removes implicit maps/lists, top-level commas, path
   dives) and remaps fixed tokens — bare `{` `[` `]` are nulled out and
   `#CL` (the key/value separator) becomes `=` instead of `:`. It also
   turns jsonic's **number lexer off** (`number.lex: false`), because
   relaxed-JSON numbers are not ZON numbers.
2. **Adds five custom lex matchers** (`zonDot`, `zonMultiString`,
   `zonChar`, `zonNumber`, `zonDocComment`) for Zig syntax the jsonic
   lexer can't express — or, for the last two, for syntax it would
   wrongly *accept*.
3. **Adds four grammar-rule alts** (`val`/`list`/`elem`/`pair`) so a
   single `}` (`#CB`) closes both struct and tuple literals, plus a
   `@pair-bc/prepend` guard that rejects duplicate field names.

The signature ZON trick: `.{` is **disambiguated at lex time** by the
`zonDot` matcher. It peeks ahead — `.{ .ident =` → emits `#OB` (struct /
map); anything else → `#OS` (tuple / list). A bare `.identifier` (or
`.@"any name"`) emits `#TX` (leading dot stripped), valid as both a `KEY`
(before `=`) and a `VAL` (an enum literal). Two options shape values:
`charAsNumber` (parse `'x'` char literals as code points vs one-char
strings) and `enumTag` (wrap enum-literal values `.foo` in
`{ [enumTag]: 'foo' }`).

## Conformance claim

**`@tabnas/zon` accepts exactly the documents `ziglang/zig` 0.16.0
accepts, and produces the same value for each.** That is not a slogan:
the reference implementation itself is the judge. `std.zig.Ast` (in
`.zon` mode) plus `std.zig.ZonGen`, from a pinned zig 0.16.0, decide
every verdict and every value in the two corpora
[`scripts/fetch-zigzon.sh`](scripts/fetch-zigzon.sh) generates.

**Measured (zig 0.16.0, commit `24fdd5b7a4c1`, both runtimes identical):**

| Corpus | Documents | Accepted correctly | Rejected correctly |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test/zigzon/cases.json` — every `.zon` file in the zig tree plus every ZON snippet in `lib/std/zon/parse.zig` | 228 | **184 / 184** (values compared, not just "it parsed") | **44 / 44** |
| `test/strictness/cases.json` — locally authored leniency probes, judged by the same oracle | 117 | **45 / 45** | **72 / 72** |

The corpora are **not bundled** — generating them downloads a pinned zig
toolchain and source tarball (~80 MB, verified by SHA-256 and cached in
`test/zigzon/vendor/`, git-ignored). They are **not opt-in**: both
runtimes generate them themselves before grading, so the suites run
everywhere `npm test` / `go test ./...` runs, CI included.

- TypeScript: the `pretest` hook in `ts/package.json`.
- Go: `TestMain` in `go/zigzon_test.go` (the shared CI workflow calls
  `go test ./...` directly and has no repo-specific step to hang a fetch
  on).

If a corpus is still missing after that, the suites **FAIL** with
instructions — they never skip. A conformance suite that quietly does not
run reports a green tick while measuring nothing, which is worse than no
suite. Both runners also pin the exact corpus census (184/44 and 45/72),
so narrowing a corpus goes red instead of inflating the pass rate.

The single exception is a host `scripts/fetch-zigzon.sh` has no pinned zig
oracle toolchain for — anything other than linux/macos on x86_64/aarch64.
There each suite emits one explicit, platform-named skip. That is a
declared platform limit, not a missing file.

Every behaviour the corpora pin that is expressible as `input → JSON` is
**also** committed as a shared fixture in [`test/spec/`](test/spec/)
(notably [`strict.tsv`](test/spec/strict.tsv)), so the same rules are
gated without the download.

### The documented deviations

Two, both about how a schema-less parser can represent a value that Zig
resolves against a target type:

1. **Numbers are IEEE-754 doubles, except integers that would lose
   precision.** An integer literal whose exact value is not representable
   as a double is returned as a **`bigint`** (TS) / **`*big.Int`** (Go)
   rather than silently rounded. Floats are always doubles: `f128`
   literals are narrowed, as they are in any JSON-shaped parser.
2. **`.{}` parses as the empty LIST**, because at the syntax level an
   empty anonymous literal is both an empty struct and an empty tuple and
   only a target type can tell them apart.

Everything else the reference rejects, this parser rejects — including
the cases jsonic's relaxed lexer would otherwise wave through
(`+1`, `.5`, `5.`, `0123`, `1__0`, `0x_2A`, `0X2A`), duplicate struct
field names, and `//!` / `///` doc comments.

## Repository map

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`ts/`](ts/) | **Canonical** TypeScript implementation — the `@tabnas/zon` package. Plugin in `src/zon.ts`. Peer-depends on `@tabnas/jsonic` and `@tabnas/parser`. No CLI. |
| [`go/`](go/) | Go port — `github.com/tabnas/zon/go` (`const VERSION` in `go/zon.go`). Plugin `Zon` plus `MakeJsonic` / `Parse` helpers. Requires the published `github.com/tabnas/jsonic/go` (no `replace` directive). |
| [`ts/zon-grammar.jsonic`](ts/zon-grammar.jsonic) | **Single source of truth** for the grammar-rule alts (the `val`/`list`/`elem`/`pair` overrides), authored in jsonic syntax. |
| [`ts/embed-grammar.js`](ts/embed-grammar.js) | Embeds `zon-grammar.jsonic` into **both** `src/zon.ts` and `go/zon.go` (between `BEGIN/END EMBEDDED` markers) as a `grammarText` string literal. Runs as the first half of `npm run build`. |
| [`test/spec/`](test/spec/) | Shared `.tsv` conformance fixtures. **Both** runners auto-discover and run every file here, so adding one covers TypeScript and Go together. See [`test/AGENTS.md`](test/AGENTS.md). |
| [`ts/test/`](ts/test/) | TS tests (`.ts`, compiled to `dist-test/`): `zon.test.ts` (parse cases), `parity.test.ts` (the shared `test/spec/*.tsv` fixtures), `zigzon.test.ts` (the zig reference corpora), `debug-model.test.ts` (the `@tabnas/debug` composition / model introspection), `doc-examples.test.ts` (runs `// =>` assertions in README/doc fences), `version.test.ts` (the exported `VERSION` vs `package.json`). |
| [`go/zon_test.go`](go/zon_test.go), [`go/parity_test.go`](go/parity_test.go), [`go/zigzon_test.go`](go/zigzon_test.go) | Go test suite — the same parse cases, the same `.tsv` fixtures, and the same zig reference corpora. |
| [`go/version_test.go`](go/version_test.go) | Checks the Go `const VERSION` against `ts/package.json` (mirrors `ts/test/version.test.ts`). Fails, never skips, if that file cannot be read. |
| [`scripts/fetch-zigzon.sh`](scripts/fetch-zigzon.sh) | Generator for the zig reference corpora, run automatically by `pretest` (ts) and `TestMain` (go): downloads a pinned zig 0.16.0 toolchain + source (each **verified against a pinned SHA-256**; a mismatch is a hard failure), builds [`test/zigzon/tools/oracle.zig`](test/zigzon/tools/oracle.zig) (a batch judge over `std.zig.Ast` + `std.zig.ZonGen`), harvests every ZON document in the tree ([`harvest.py`](test/zigzon/tools/harvest.py)) and records its verdict ([`judge.py`](test/zigzon/tools/judge.py)). |
| [`test/strictness/inputs.txt`](test/strictness/inputs.txt) | The locally authored leniency probes. This file decides the **questions**; the oracle decides every **answer**. |
| [`ts/doc/grammar.svg`](ts/doc/grammar.svg), [`ts/doc/grammar.txt`](ts/doc/grammar.txt) | Railroad / ASCII diagram of the live grammar, generated by `@tabnas/railroad`. |
| [`ts/doc/`](ts/doc/), [`go/doc/`](go/doc/) | Per-runtime 4-quadrant Diataxis docs: `tutorial.md`, `guide.md`, `reference.md`, `concepts.md` (the Go `concepts.md` also covers differences from TS). |

## The tabnas engine dependency

This repo sits **above jsonic** in the stack, not directly above the bare
engine. The packages are **published on npm** (`@tabnas/*`); the
`file:` paths in `package.json` are the monorepo dev layout, not a
requirement.

- TypeScript: `@tabnas/jsonic` and `@tabnas/parser` are both
  `peerDependencies` in `ts/package.json` (that file is the authority on
  the accepted ranges), each mirrored as a `file:../../<dep>/ts`
  devDependency for monorepo builds. `@tabnas/debug`
  and `@tabnas/railroad` are **dev-only** `file:` devDependencies — debug
  for the `debug-model.test.ts` composition test, railroad to regenerate
  `ts/doc/grammar.{svg,txt}`. The supported Node floor is `engines.node`
  in the same file (builds/tests also run on the previous Node LTS with
  harmless `EBADENGINE` warnings).
- Go: `go/go.mod` `require`s the published modules directly
  (`github.com/tabnas/{jsonic,json,parser}/go`, at the versions pinned in
  that file) with **no `replace`** — `go build`/`go test` resolve them
  from the module proxy.

**Two dev models:**
- *Monorepo:* clone `jsonic` and `parser` (plus `json`, `debug`,
  `railroad`) as siblings, build the TS halves (`cd parser/ts && npm
  install && npm run build`, likewise `jsonic/ts`), then work here. CI
  (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) does this.
- *Isolated single-repo checkout:* the `file:` symlinks dangle; install
  the registry versions instead. See
  [`TEMPLATE.md` §4](TEMPLATE.md#4-dev-environment-realities) for the exact
  verified green-build recipe.

## Authority and alignment rules

1. **TypeScript is canonical.** When TS and Go disagree on parse
   behavior, TS wins; change Go to match.
2. **The grammar source is single-sourced, not duplicated.**
   `ts/zon-grammar.jsonic` is authored once; `embed-grammar.js` copies it
   verbatim into the `grammarText` literal in both `src/zon.ts` and
   `go/zon.go`. **Never hand-edit the text between the
   `--- BEGIN/END EMBEDDED zon-grammar.jsonic ---` markers** in either
   file — edit `zon-grammar.jsonic` and re-run `npm run embed` (or
   `npm run build`, which embeds first). The Go embed step rejects a
   grammar containing backticks (incompatible with Go raw strings).
3. The two ports must produce the same values for the same input. The
   parity contract is the shared grammar source plus the shared
   `test/spec/*.tsv` fixtures, which both runtimes auto-discover (see
   [`test/AGENTS.md`](test/AGENTS.md)). Add a new parse case there; the
   in-language suites keep only what a fixture cannot express.
4. The jsonic option overrides (`rule.exclude`, `fixed.token`,
   `tokenSet.KEY`, `string`, `number`, `error`, `comment`, `value`,
   `text.lex`, `lex.match`) and the five lex matchers exist in **both**
   runtimes and must stay in step — they all live on the grammar object
   so the plugin applies them atomically alongside its rule alts. Note
   Go's `comment` block carries extra defs (hash/multi) the TS side
   leaves to jsonic defaults; keep observable behavior aligned even where
   the option surface differs slightly.
5. The `Defaults` (`charAsNumber: false`, `enumTag` empty) and `VERSION`
   const in `go/zon.go` mirror the TS `Zon.defaults` and the exported
   `VERSION` in `ts/src/zon.ts`. Both `VERSION` constants MUST equal
   `ts/package.json` "version" — `go/version_test.go` and
   `ts/test/version.test.ts` read that file and fail (never skip) on drift.
   The release orchestrator (`admin/publish.sh`) rewrites both.

## Repo-specific gotchas

- **The `enumTag` rewrap hook differs by runtime.** TS wraps the
  enum-literal node in the `@val-ac` (after-close) phase, because the
  relaxed-JSON grammar `/replace`s `@val-bc` and the engine then
  suppresses any `/prepend` on it. Go uses `@val-bc/prepend`. Both
  guard on `tkn.use.zonEnum` (the marker the `zonDot` matcher sets) and
  only fire when `enumTag` is set. Don't "unify" these phases without
  re-checking which one the live jsonic grammar leaves available.
- **`zonDot` must out-order the fixed-token matcher** so it owns the `.`
  prefix (TS `order: 1e5`; Go `Order: 100000`). The other two matchers
  order after it.
- **The list rules close on `#CB` (`}`), not the default `#CS`** — this
  is what lets one `}` terminate both `.{ ... }` struct and tuple forms.
  The empty `.{}` is steered to an empty **list**.
- **The default jsonic text matcher is disabled** (`text.lex: false`):
  identifiers only ever appear as `.ident` / `.@"..."` and are produced by
  `zonDot`. `true`/`false`/`null` still lex, because the text matcher
  matches `value.def` entries even when text lexing is off.
- **`zonNumber` owns every numeric token, including the leading `-` and
  the `inf`/`nan` keywords.** jsonic's number lexer is switched off, so
  nothing else will produce an `#NR`. It reproduces Zig's literal grammar
  (base prefixes must be lowercase, `_` must sit between digits, no
  leading zero, no `+`, hex floats via `p`), and returns a
  `bigint`/`*big.Int` when a double would lose the exact integer value.
- **`zonDocComment` runs at order 1.4e5, ahead of jsonic's comment
  matcher (6e6).** It only ever *fails* the lex, on `//!` and `///`;
  `////` and plain `//` fall through to the comment matcher.
- **Duplicate field names are caught in `@pair-bc/prepend`,** which must
  run before jsonic's own `@pair-bc` (that one performs the assignment,
  so by `@pair-ac` the collision is gone). `/prepend` is available here
  precisely because jsonic declares a *plain* `@pair-bc`; contrast
  `@val-bc`, which it takes with `/replace`. Go state actions cannot
  return an error token, so the Go side signals via `ctx.ParseErr`.
- **Whitespace and comments may sit between `.` and what follows**
  (`. foo`, `. {}`), because Zig's tokenizer emits them as separate
  tokens. `skipInsigPos` tracks rows/columns across that gap so error
  positions stay honest.
- The Go plugin guards against re-invocation with a `zon-init`
  decoration (jsonic `SetOptions` re-applies plugins); don't remove it.

## Build & test

TypeScript (from `ts/`):

```bash
npm install            # auto-installs the @tabnas/jsonic + @tabnas/parser peers; resolves file: siblings
npm run build          # node embed-grammar.js && tsc --build src test
npm test               # node --enable-source-maps --test "dist-test/*.test.js"
```

`npm run build` **embeds the grammar first** (into `src/zon.ts` and
`go/zon.go`), then `tsc --build`s both `src` and `test` — the tests are
written in TypeScript and compiled to `dist-test/`, unlike some sibling
repos that ship committed `.test.js`. The grammar diagram is regenerated
with `@tabnas/railroad` off the live config (`ts/doc/grammar.{svg,txt}`).

Go (from `go/`):

```bash
go build ./...
go test -v ./...       # plugin parse cases + test/spec fixtures + the zig
                       # reference corpora (TestMain generates them first)
```

The zig reference corpora are generated automatically by both runtimes
before they grade — `pretest` in `ts/`, `TestMain` in `go/`. Building them
by hand, from the repo root:

```bash
make corpus                    # == bash scripts/fetch-zigzon.sh
                               # ~80MB download on first run, then cached
```

The repo-root [`Makefile`](Makefile) (adapted from voxgig/util) wraps
both halves: `make build|test|clean` run the TS and Go sides, `make reset`
rebuilds from clean, `make tags-go` lists `go/v*` tags, and
`make publish-go V=x.y.z` injects `V` into the `const VERSION` in
`go/zon.go`, commits, and tags `go/vX.Y.Z`. `make publish-ts` publishes
the TS package at its `package.json` version. (`ts/Makefile` has most of the
same targets scoped to the package — `publish-go`/`tags-go`/`tidy-go`/`reset`
— but no `publish-ts`.)

## Composition test (@tabnas/debug)

`ts/test/debug-model.test.ts` proves the plugin composes with the
[`@tabnas/debug`](https://github.com/tabnas/debug) introspection plugin.
`@tabnas/debug` is a `file:` devDependency, so plain `npm test` runs it;
it resolves debug dynamically and **skips** when absent (set
`TABNAS_DEBUG_PATH` to a built sibling checkout to force it). It asserts:

- the structured rule set is `['elem','list','map','pair','val']`,
- `m.config.start === 'val'` (note `config.start`, **not** `m.start`),
- `Zon` is in `m.plugins`,
- the push edges: `val` open-pushes both `map` **and** `list` (the
  struct-vs-tuple disambiguation), `map`→`pair`, `list`→`elem`, and
  `pair`/`elem` close-replace themselves to iterate members,
- and that the model is JSON-serialisable and round-trips.

There is no Go equivalent of this test; the Go suite is self-contained.

## CI

`.github/workflows/build.yml` has two jobs, neither publishing to npm:

- **build** (Ubuntu/Windows/macOS, Node 24): sets
  `git config --global core.autocrlf false` (CRLF would corrupt the
  embedded grammar / line-sensitive sources), git-clones the tabnas
  closure (`parser debug json abnf railroad jsonic`) as siblings, runs
  `npm i && npm run build --if-present` for each (then `zon`), and
  `npm test` here. Because `@tabnas/debug` is a devDependency, the
  composition test runs as part of `npm test`.
- **build-go** (Ubuntu/macOS, Go 1.24): clones the same siblings,
  mirrors `admin/scripts/link.sh` by creating `vendor/` symlinks for any
  `../vendor/` replaces and a `go work` over every non-vendor-replaced
  module, then `go build` / `go test -v` here.
