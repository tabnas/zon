# Tabnas Plugin Template Guide

`@tabnas/zon` doubles as the **template** you copy to start a new Tabnas
grammar plugin (e.g. `@tabnas/proto` was bootstrapped from it). This file
is for an agent *starting a fresh plugin*: it separates the reusable
scaffolding from the ZON-specific parts, documents the engine model every
plugin author needs, maps the ecosystem so you pick the right base, and
lists the dev-environment realities that aren't obvious from a clone.

For the ZON plugin's own internals (the jsonic layering, lex matchers,
parity rules), see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

> Every engine-behaviour claim below was read off the published
> `@tabnas/parser` source (`dist/defaults.js`, `dist/lexer.js`,
> `dist/rules.js`, `dist/builtins.js`), not folklore. You don't need to
> read `dist/` yourself.

## 1. Using this repo as a template

### Reusable — copy as-is, retune lightly

| Piece | What to keep |
|---|---|
| **Dual-runtime layout** | `ts/` is canonical, `go/` tracks it. TS wins on any behaviour disagreement; change Go to match. Drop `go/` entirely if you only want TS. |
| **Single-source grammar + embed** | One `*-grammar.jsonic` at the repo root is the only hand-edited grammar. `ts/embed-grammar.js` copies it verbatim into the `grammarText` literal in **both** `ts/src/<plugin>.ts` and `go/<plugin>.go`, between `// --- BEGIN/END EMBEDDED ... ---` markers. Never hand-edit between the markers; edit the `.jsonic` and run `npm run embed`. The Go embed rejects backticks (Go raw-string limitation). |
| **node:test + dist layout** | Tests are authored in TS under `ts/test/*.test.ts`, compiled to `dist-test/`, run with `node --test "dist-test/*.test.js"`. `src` → `dist`, `test` → `dist-test`. No bundler, no jest. |
| **doc-examples harness** | `ts/test/doc-examples.test.ts` is identical across tabnas repos. It scans markdown, runs ` ```js ` blocks that contain a `// =>` assertion, and checks each `<expr> // => <expected>`. Keep it; your README examples become tests for free. |
| **Diataxis doc set** | `ts/doc/{tutorial,guide,reference,concepts}.md` (+ `go/doc/`). One file per quadrant, per runtime. Rewrite the prose; keep the four-file shape. |
| **Makefile / CI shape** | Root `Makefile` wraps both runtimes (`build`/`test`/`clean`/`reset`, `publish-ts`, `publish-go V=x.y.z`, `tags-go`). `.github/workflows/build.yml` has a `build` (Node, multi-OS) and `build-go` job. Reuse the structure; swap the package name. |
| **package.json conventions** | Engine deps (`@tabnas/parser`, and `@tabnas/jsonic`/`@tabnas/abnf` if you base on one) are **`peerDependencies`** (`^0.2.0`), each mirrored as a `file:../../<dep>/ts` **devDependency** for monorepo dev. `@tabnas/debug` / `@tabnas/railroad` are dev-only `file:` deps. `engines.node` is `>=24`. |

### ZON-specific — rewrite for your format

These exist because ZON is a JSON-family format layered on jsonic. A
*different* format replaces them wholesale:

- **The jsonic layering.** `new Tabnas().use(jsonic).use(Zon)` and the
  `rule.exclude: 'jsonic,imp'` / fixed-token remaps that disable jsonic
  features ZON doesn't want. Only relevant if you also base on jsonic.
- **The custom lex matchers** `zonDot` / `zonMultiString` / `zonChar` —
  Zig syntax (`.{`, `\\`-prefixed multiline strings, `'x'` char literals)
  the jsonic lexer can't express. Your format needs its *own* matchers (or
  none).
- **The token remaps** — `#CL` → `=` instead of `:`, nulling out bare
  `{` `[` `]`, `KEY: ['#TX']`. These encode ZON's surface syntax.
- **The `enumTag` / `charAsNumber` plugin options** and the `@val-ac`
  enum-rewrap hook.

**If your language is not JSON-family, do not start from the jsonic
layering at all** — see §3.

## 2. The tabnas engine model

A plugin is a function `(tn, options) => { ... }` that adds lex matchers
and grammar rules to a `Tabnas` engine. To write one you need the lexer
model and the parse model.

### Lexer — a plain whole-word tokeniser

The lexer walks the source and emits **whole-word tokens**, trying a fixed
list of matchers in ascending `order` until one matches. Defaults
(`dist/defaults.js`, `lex.match`):

| order | matcher | emits |
|---|---|---|
| 1e6 | match | custom token/value matchers (`match.token`) |
| 2e6 | fixed | the fixed punctuation tokens below |
| 3e6 | space | `#SP` |
| 4e6 | line | `#LN` |
| 5e6 | string | `#ST` |
| 6e6 | comment | `#CM` |
| 7e6 | number | `#NR` |
| 8e6 | text | `#TX` bareword, or `#VL` for a keyword value |

**Lower `order` runs first.** A custom matcher registers under
`options.lex.match.<name> = { order, make }`. To own a prefix the
fixed matcher would otherwise grab (as ZON's `zonDot` owns `.`), give it an
`order` below `2e6` — ZON uses `1e5`.

The four value-bearing tokens an alt can match as a `VAL`/`KEY`:

- `#TX` — bareword / identifier (text matcher; `val` = the word)
- `#NR` — number (hex/oct/bin/`_` separators on by default)
- `#ST` — quoted string
- `#VL` — a keyword value: `true`/`false`/`null` (from `value.def`)

Default **fixed tokens** (`fixed.token`): `{`→`#OB`, `}`→`#CB`,
`[`→`#OS`, `]`→`#CS`, `:`→`#CL`, `,`→`#CA`. Remap or null these to
reshape surface syntax (ZON nulls `#OB`/`#OS`/`#CS` and sets `#CL` to `=`).

**Whitespace, newlines and comments are ignored by the parser.** The
lexer still emits `#SP`/`#LN`/`#CM`, but `tokenSet.IGNORE =
['#SP','#LN','#CM']` tells the parser to skip them between meaningful
tokens — so your grammar never mentions whitespace. Two other token sets
matter: `VAL` and `KEY` (both `['#TX','#NR','#ST','#VL']` by default) list
which tokens may stand as a value or a key.

### Parser — rules, alts, and the result value

The parser runs a stack of **rules**. Each rule has an **open** phase and
a **close** phase, each a list of **alts** (alternatives). Parsing starts
at `rule.start` (default `'val'`). An alt is matched against the upcoming
tokens; the first alt whose token pattern matches fires.

**Alt fields** (from `dist/rules.js`):

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `s` | token-match sequence — space-separated token names to look ahead for, e.g. `'#OS #CB'`. A `null` position is a wildcard. |
| `p` | **push** a named rule (descend into a child rule) |
| `r` | **replace** the current rule with a named rule (loop / iterate siblings) |
| `b` | **backtrack** N tokens — matched but *not* consumed, so the next rule re-reads them |
| `g` | **group tags**, comma-separated, for `rule.include`/`rule.exclude` filtering |
| `a` | **action** — a function `(rule, ctx, alt)` or a `@named` builtin ref, run when the alt fires |
| `c` | optional condition predicate; `n` counters; `u`/`k` custom props (`k` propagates to children); `e` error |

**Rule lifecycle** (per rule instance):
`before-open (bo)` → match an open alt + `after-open (ao)` → *(push
children via `p`)* → `before-close (bc)` → match a close alt +
`after-close (ac)`. You hook a phase with a reserved handler named
`@<rule>-bo|ao|bc|ac`, optionally suffixed `/prepend`, `/append`, or
`/replace`. `/replace` takes ownership of the phase and suppresses other
handlers on it — a real gotcha when composing plugins (it's why ZON's
enum rewrap runs on `@val-ac`, not `@val-bc`, which jsonic has replaced).

**Result value: `{rule,src,kids}` vs a native value.** By default the
engine's `mkNode` builds a generic parse node `{ rule, src, kids }` (a
CST). But a real plugin builds a **native JS/Go value** by writing
`r.node` in its actions, using the builtins in `dist/builtins.js`:

- `@map$` allocates `r.node = {}`, `@array$` allocates `r.node = []`
- the `pair` rule sets `node[key] = child.node`; the `elem` rule pushes
  `child.node` into the array; `@val$` coalesces a child node or the
  matched token's `val`

The final parse result is the start rule's `r.node`. So "turning a parse
into a value" = wiring actions that allocate a container on open and fold
each child into it on close. ZON reuses jsonic's `val`/`map`/`list`/
`pair`/`elem` machinery and only overrides which tokens open/close them.

### Gotchas that cost time

- **Group tags must match `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+$/`** (verified in
  `rules.js`). Note the `+`: a *single* letter is **invalid** — `g: 'a'`
  throws, `g: 'aa'` or `g: 'a1'` is fine.
- **Option injection — the "zon pattern".** Build the grammar object,
  then attach overrides to it so the plugin applies atomically:
  ```js
  const grammarDef = new Tabnas().use(jsonic).parse(grammarText)
  grammarDef.ref = { '@val-ac': (r, ctx) => { /* handler */ } }
  grammarDef.options = {
    rule:   { exclude: '...', start: 'val' },
    fixed:  { token: { '#CL': '=', '#OB': null } },
    string: { /* ... */ },
    lex:    { match: { myMatcher: { order: 1e5, make: buildMyMatcher() } } },
  }
  tn.grammar(grammarDef, { rule: { alt: { g: 'myplugin' } } })
  ```
  Per-plugin scalar options ride on `tn.options({ config: { modify: {...} } })`.
  Tagging every alt with one group (`g: 'myplugin'`) lets callers
  `rule.exclude: 'myplugin'` to turn your plugin off.

## 3. Ecosystem map — pick the right base

| Package | Use when |
|---|---|
| **`@tabnas/parser`** | The engine (lexer + rule/alt parser). Everything depends on it; you rarely build directly on the bare engine. |
| **`@tabnas/jsonic`** | Relaxed-JSON grammar plugin. **Base for JSON-family formats** — JSON5-likes, ZON, config dialects with `{}`/`[]`/`key: value` shape. |
| **`@tabnas/abnf`** | Compiles an RFC-5234 **ABNF** grammar into a `GrammarSpec`. **Base for arbitrary / keyword-rich languages.** |
| **`@tabnas/json`** | Strict RFC-8259 JSON. A reference plugin / minimal base. |
| **`@tabnas/debug`** | Introspection + tracing; adds `describe()` and a serialisable model. Dev/test only. |
| **`@tabnas/railroad`** | Renders a railroad/syntax diagram from the live config. Dev/docs only. |

**Decision rule:** if your language is **not** JSON-shaped (a DSL, a
config syntax with keywords, an RFC-defined wire format), author it as an
**ABNF grammar compiled via `@tabnas/abnf`** — do **not** hand-write
jsonic rule alts. Hand-written jsonic layering only pays off for
JSON-family formats that genuinely reuse jsonic's relaxed-JSON behaviour
(as ZON does).

## 4. Dev-environment realities

### The `file:` deps don't exist in an isolated checkout

`ts/package.json` lists `"@tabnas/parser": "file:../../parser/ts"` (and
jsonic/debug/railroad) as devDependencies — the **monorepo dev layout**,
where every tabnas package is a sibling directory. In an isolated
single-repo clone those paths don't exist, so `npm install` creates
**dangling symlinks** and `tsc` then fails with `Cannot find module
'@tabnas/parser'`. The packages **are published on npm**, so install the
registry versions over the symlinks.

**Verified green-build recipe for an isolated `ts/` checkout:**

```bash
cd ts
npm install            # pulls typescript + @types/node; leaves dangling @tabnas symlinks (harmless)
npm install --no-save @tabnas/parser@^0.2.0 @tabnas/jsonic@^0.2.0 \
                      @tabnas/debug@^0.2.0 @tabnas/railroad@^0.2.0
npm run build          # embed-grammar.js + tsc --build src test
npm test               # node --test dist-test/*.test.js  (40 tests, incl. debug-model + doc-examples)
```

`--no-save` replaces the symlinks with real registry installs without
rewriting `package.json` (keep the `file:` deps for monorepo dev). Drop
`@tabnas/jsonic` from the install line for a non-jsonic plugin; add
whatever base you actually use.

**Go needs nothing extra.** `go/go.mod` `require`s the published modules
directly (`github.com/tabnas/{jsonic,json,parser}/go v0.2.0`) with **no
`replace` directive**, so `go build ./... && go test -v ./...` resolves
them from the module proxy in a bare checkout.

### Node engine

`engines.node` is `>=24`, but the build and tests **run on Node 22** —
you'll just see harmless `npm warn EBADENGINE` lines. Don't let those warnings
read as failures.

### How the doc-examples harness resolves `require()`

In `ts/test/doc-examples.test.ts`, a doc example's `require(spec)`:

- resolves normally from this package's `node_modules` first;
- if that misses, **own package name** (`@tabnas/<this>`) → this repo's
  `ts/` directory (self-reference);
- any other `@tabnas/<x>` → the **sibling** repo `../<x>/ts` (monorepo
  fallback).

Only ` ```js ` / ` ```javascript ` blocks containing a `// =>` line are
executed; blocks with no `// =>` are treated as illustrative and skipped,
and ` ```js ignore ` is excluded explicitly.
