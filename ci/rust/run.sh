# The engine, the relaxed-JSON grammar (which takes the JSON core by path
# itself) and the fixture runner are PATH DEPENDENCIES on sibling checkouts
# (rs/Cargo.toml: `tabnas = { path = "../../parser/rs" }`,
# `tabnas-jsonic = { path = "../../jsonic/rs" }`, and as dev-dependencies
# `tabnas-support = { path = "../../support/rs" }` and
# `tabnas-debug = { path = "../../debug/rs" }`). None is published, so
# there is no registry version to fall back on. Clone
# https://github.com/tabnas/parser, https://github.com/tabnas/json,
# https://github.com/tabnas/jsonic, https://github.com/tabnas/support and

# the crate's own version alone, so it sails past the comparison above while
# leaving the committed lock stale -- cargo then regenerates it in the
# runner and everything goes green.
#
# So the whole resolution is compared, before and after cargo runs, with one
# exemption: the recorded version of each sibling path crate (the engine,
# the JSON core, the jsonic grammar, the fixture runner and the debug
# plugin). Those entries legitimately move
# whenever the sibling checkouts do, and exempting exactly them is what
# makes a full comparison usable here when blanket `--locked` is not.
